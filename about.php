                        <p class="text-justify font-weight-bold">Sri Sri Adivasi Gram Charitable Trust was formed with
                            the main objective of being helpful for the development of the people of Khewada and the
                            tribal area of Khewada.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify font-weight-bold ">The trust was approved on the eighth day of the
                            revolutionary month of August 2008. Since then till today, many social useful activities
                            have been done by the trust.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify font-weight-bold">Mainly the tribal area of Tapi, Narmada and Dang
                            district has been the working area of our trust. In this area many social evils like
                            superstition, addiction are prevalent due to unemployment, poverty and illiteracy. The trust
                            has many projects like tree plantation for public awareness, de-addiction, self-reliance and
                            environmental enrichment. have been carried out.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify font-weight-bold">So far, more than 1000 youths have been completely
                            freed from addiction through the Addiction Mukti Abhiyan. As many as 400 youths have been
                            made yoga gurus by imparting yoga training. Those who have gained foothold as yoga teachers.
                            The trust distributes fruit tree saplings free of charge, from which many families today
                            ripen their own Ambawadi mangoes. Also getting income from other fruit trees. Along with
                            people becoming self-sufficient, the environment is also being enriched through tree
                            cultivation.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify font-weight-bold">Animal donation activity of the trust has also been
                            very useful for self-reliance and self-employment. As many as 440 livestock from Panjrapol
                            have been distributed to the needy people for animal husbandry from which these families
                            have become self-sufficient by producing milk and manure.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify font-weight-bold">By giving systematic training in organic farming
                            through the trust, many farmers have been made to buy organic produce through organic
                            farming. This experiment of environmental enrichment and land conservation along with
                            economic employment is truly exemplary.</p>
